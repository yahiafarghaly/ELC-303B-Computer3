For Bash
-----------------------
to cancel () syntex token error in bash script you need to precude any syntex token with \ or 
convey the whole expression with ' ' and it will send to the program without ' ' 
so in SparktestCases i do ' '  as i run from bash shell-to execute Sparktb :)- BUT if you going 
to run it from GUI arg of eclispe it will be fine without ' ' as it's not a shell ! 
This just in case you transfer to the Windows OS so you will need to change the SparktestCases's Contents.

6) you may find a more larger datatype for factorial to get more in higher numbers
7)should i care about .25 or 2.  ?  i think no
9)3!! is not a valid syntex it should be (3!)! but ask if it's valid to this assignment
10) you should handle making ()() or 2() to be ()*() and 2*() in isValidToCalculate() 
to be safe expression for parseMathematicalExpression() >> no,it's invalid
complete error handling tommorow
